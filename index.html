        <h1> Things about Nanami Kento</h1>
    </header>
    <section>
        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <p>
            Nanami Kento (七海建人) is a major supporting character in Jujutsu Kaisen. He was a former
            student of Tokyo Jujutsu High where he was an underclassman of Satoru Gojo and Suguru Geto. Nanami initially
            left Jujutsu High after graduating to become a salaryman, but returned four years later to continue working
            as a jujutsu sorcerer.
        <p>
            While working as a Jujutsu High sorcerer, Nanami was ranked grade 1 and operated primarily out of the Tokyo
            campus. With Satoru's introduction, he also became a close mentor to Yuji Itadori.

        </p>

        <h2>Appearance</h2>
        <p>Nanami is a tall, well-built man with blonde hair styled with a neat part. Nanami has very thin eyebrows as
            well as small eyes that are usually covered by his signature sunglasses, which don't have arms that wrap
            around the ears.
        <p>
            Befitting a former office worker, Nanami is usually fully dressed in a business suit. His usual suit
            consists of a blue dress shirt underneath a tan blazer with matching slacks and light shoes. Attached to his
            dress shirt, there is a holster that sheaths Nanami's blunt sword, hidden by the back of his blazer. He also
            sports a necktie that shares the same dotted pattern as the bandages around his blunt sword.

        <p>
            After graduating from Jujutsu High and working for corporate, Nanami wore a vertical striped jacket over a
            white button-down shirt and dark-colored tie with white dots all over it, vertical striped pants, and black
            shoes. As a student, Nanami wore a normal Jujutsu High uniform. His hair was styled slightly differently
            when he was younger.

        <h2>Personality</h2>
        <p>
            Nanami is a very wise and reserved kind of man, often appearing so calm and indifferent that he comes
            off as
            stoic and aloof. He seems like the kind of person who's too serious about his work, but Nanami just
            knows
            how to separate sentimentalism from service. He's blunt and straight to the point in most conversations
            and
            doesn't care for impractical optimism or questions left open to interpretation.
        <p>
            Additionally, Nanami is very avid and quick to express his irritation, either on his face and verbally
            with
            his words. Nanami is often very impatient. He hates working overtime and is very serious about not going
            a
            single minute over what's required of him.
        <p>
            Nanami knows being a jujutsu sorcerer is a dangerous and demanding job for crazy people, and so he has a
            hard time respecting people in the profession. Even though Nanami and Satoru are longtime friends, the
            former claims he doesn't respect Satoru despite their mutual trust in one another. He returned to being
            a sorcerer from the life of a salaryman because he never felt truly appreciated and didn't believe his
            work
            had any significant impact on anyone. In contrast, work as a sorcerer allowed him to build up small bits
            of
            appreciation from innocent people. For Nanami, this was more than enough to allow him to live without
            regrets.

        <h2>Abilities and Powers</h2>
        <p> <strong>Master Swordsman:</strong> Nanami mainly utilizes a blunt sword in battle and does so with
            incredible proficiency.
            Combined with his cursed technique, Nanami can cut through anything, including a blocking opponent that is
            using cursed energy to defend themselves. Nanami wields his blade with grace and balance, striking with
            extreme speed and precision with every swipe of his sword.
            <center><img class="custom-image" src="images/Sword.jpg"></center>
        <p> <strong>Master Hand-to-Hand Combatant:</strong> In addition to being adept at armed combat, Nanami is an
            extremely capable
            unarmed fighter as well. His innate technique works with his fists as well as it does with his blunt sword.
            Nanami used this method to effortlessly overpower the curse user Haruta Shigemo. Each of Nanami's blows were
            incredibly devastating, a simple backhand was enough to send Shigemo flying across the room. There was never
            a point in the fight where Nanami was any danger fighting at close range, he delivered one bone-shattering
            blow after another and Shigemo would have died if not for his cursed technique.
            <center><img class="custom-image" src="images/HAND.jpg"></center>

        <p> <strong>Great Tactical Intellect:</strong> Nanami's greatest assets in battle outside of his cursed
            technique are his astute
            fighting instincts and deductive reasoning skills. Both times he fought Mahito Nanami knew he was outmatched
            in terms of raw cursed energy, however, he survived both accounts and overwhelmed Mahito on several
            occasions thanks to quick thinking and masterful execution.</p>
        <p> <strong>Enhanced Durability:</strong> Nanami is incredibly durable for a human even by sorcerer standards.
            As previously
            mentioned, he was able to survive being touched by Mahito's Idle Transfiguration and continued to fight and
            eventually escaped with his life and body intact. When Shigemo fought Nanami he attempted to cut and
            kick him right after. However, Nanami was unscathed from the slash and didn't move as much as an inch from
            the curse user's kick. Shigemo compared hitting Nanami to a stone wall and said it felt like he wasn't even
            hitting a person. Additionally, Nanami was able to survive an endless swarm of man-eating fish shikigami
            for over a minute and was attacked by Jogo shortly after that. He was miraculously able to survive both and
            was even able to continue fighting, unlike Maki and Naobito who were completely incapacitated and
            near-death.</p>
        <p> <strong>Superior Precision & Technique:</strong> Nanami is an extremely technical fighter who plans on using
            his every move to
            exploit an opening in his opponent. His aim is always extremely precise, as he never misses his target's
            weak point when it's exposed by his cursed technique. Against stronger opponents, Nanami fights by breaking
            them down and creating constant weak points until they eventually fall. This same level of precision allows
            Nanami to evade his opponent's attacks with clever maneuvers. For example, by sticking his sword into a
            wall, Nanami was able to raise his legs high enough to avoid a ranged attack from Mahito.</p>
